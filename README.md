## Problem Statement:

The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured
using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete
is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test
strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and
effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we
need for acceptable compressive strength.

## Proposed Solution:

A possible solution would be to create a Machine Learning model which would predict the compressive strength of the concrete given the quantity of the ingredients.

In this web app, we just need to enter the amount of ingredients and the model will give a prediction on the compressive strength of the concrete if made with those amount of ingredients.
